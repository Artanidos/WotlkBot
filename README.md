# WotlkBot
The WotlkBot shall be a possibilty to turn your charcater to become a bot and to join your party or raid.  
The user can create a Python script to control the bots behaviour.

This software shall only be used for your own private server like AzerothCore to be able to go into dungeons and raids alone.
It can also be used on other private servers, where botting is allowed. Maybe Solocraft could allow to use it, because they have also party-bots implemented.
